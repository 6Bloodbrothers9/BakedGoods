# JASONS TEST (11/04)
# I added the image into the main folder for the rectangular placeholder because it doesn't grab it from my images folder on my local machine. We will need to edit the filepath when putting onto the hosting server
branched off into jasontest
notes: the image isn't floating fully left as in the wireframe. We may need to set a margin property or translate the divs slightly to the left with an !important.
Added opacity on hover (I'm assuming this is what was meant by image "highlighting")
# added a new image for the landing as an example because with the text color it was not showing nicely on the screen. We can chat about this when we are both awake
let me know what you want to do with the landing page as I animated the text. If you don't like it then we just need to insert the text into the "p" element and remove the index js file.

# the text on the image needs sizing for small screens as it extends over the image (11/04)
